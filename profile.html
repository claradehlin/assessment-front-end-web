<p>This is what I look like! I published a book last summer to educate people on asexuality.</p>
<h3>First and foremost, I am a mother to my hamster, Mr. Morton. I'm obsessed with him.</h3>
<img src="https://www.animalfunfacts.net/images/stories/pets/hamster/teddy_syrian_hamster_walnut_l.jpg">
<p>I named him after a Schoolhouse Rock song. He's a free-roaming hamster and also a very sleepy boy.</p>

<h3>This is my family. They are the reason I am so super tall.</h3>
<p>I was born in Issaquah, Washington, right by Seattle. I have three siblings and I'm the second youngest, which means I was the child that got no attention. As a result, I won the spelling bee and the school mile every year, and I can also be very annoying.</p>

<h3>These are my parents. They are so super cute and I love them.</h3>
<p>I grew up super mormon in small town North Logan, Utah, and then my dad got excommunicated. It was a wild time. We were shunned from our neighborhood and then all moved to Salt Lake City, where people don't care as much about your religious status.</p>
